In this project, a car simulator is used to collect data and train a neural network such that it can clone driving pattern of human. 
Several images from the road are saved and then processed such that the neural network learns how to produce proper steering angle as output in each different situation. Then the results are tested on the simulator in the autonomous driving mode that uses real-time camera images and controls the steering angle of the car.
